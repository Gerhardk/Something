# If you are using mssql, derby, hsqldb, h2 or oracle with one of the
# ActiveRecord JDBC adapters, configure your database setting as the
# example below. (Note that for oracle you will need to include the
# driver jar on the classpath.):
#
#development:
# adapter: mssql
# username: <username>
# password: <password>
# host: localhost
# database: dummy

# If you are using db2, sybase, informix or prefer to directly specify
# the JDBC connection information, configure your database setting as
# the example below (requires you to download and manually install the
# database vendor's JDBC driver .jar file). See your driver
# documentation for the apropriate driver class and connection string:
#
#development:
# adapter: jdbc
# username: <username>
# password: <password>
# driver: com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver
# url: jdbc:db2://localhost:5021/dummy

# SQLite version 3.x
# gem install sqlite3
development:
  adapter: sqlserver
  dsn: battleships_development
  mode: odbc
  database: battleships_development

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  adapter: sqlserver
  dsn: battleships_test
  mode: odbc
  database: battleships_test


production:
  adapter: jdbc
  driver: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
  url: jdbc:sqlserver://localhost;integratedSecurity=true;databaseName=battleships_development
